# Hi there, I'm Love!

I'm a fifth-year Industrial Engineering student with a specialisation in Software Intensive Systems and a big interest in programming, data science and mathematics.
Here on my GitHub are a few of the projects I have developed over the last few years, either for school assignments or for fun in my free time.

## Projects
Here are a few examples of what I’ve worked on (links to be updated):
- [Pac-Man Clone (Java)](https://github.com/your-username/pacman-game) – A retro-style game built with Swing.  
- [Fall Detection App (Android/Java)](https://github.com/your-username/fall-detector) – Detects falls via accelerometer and notifies caregivers.  
- [Data Analysis Scripts (Python/R)](https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis) – Scripts for statistics, visualization, and insights.  
- [Web Projects (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP)](https://github.com/your-username/web-projects) – Small-scale web applications and experiments.
