# Hi there, I'm Love!

I'm a fifth-year Industrial Engineering student with a specialisation in Software Intensive Systems and a big interest in programming, data science and mathematics.
Here on my GitHub are a few of the projects I have developed over the last few years, either for school assignments or for fun in my free time.
